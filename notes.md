ImageSummaryApp.java Notes
------------------------------------------

- this runs everything

- we need 3 argument from the user like image file, hex color, threhold number

what it does:

- loads the image

- checks each pixel, if its close to the color then it makes white or else black

- save the binarized image

- finds group of pixels (white)

- writes them into the csv file as in like x, y and size
